# Fried Chicken
Serves 2

## Ingredients
* One whole chicken / 2-4lbs skin-on chicken breasts & thighs
* Neutral frying oil
* Salt
* 2 tablespoons paprika & black pepper
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder && dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 egg
* 1 cup buttermilk (plain milk will also work)
* 1 1/2 cups flour

## Directions
* If you have a whole chicken, break it up into 10 pieces (4 breast pieces, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks)
* The brine: Pour about 2L of water into a large container. Add 100g of salt to the container. Add the chicken pieces and store in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours, up to 24.
* After the time has passed, take the chicken out of the brine and pat dry. Add frying oil in a wok, large cast iron skillet, or dutch oven. Heat to 350 degrees fahrenheight.
* While the oil is heating, add the egg to a bowl and whisk until homogeneous. Add milk. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregeno, cayenne pepper, and 1tsp of salt.
* Add half of the chicken to your milk/egg bowl. Then one-by-one, add the chicken to the flour mixture, coat thoroughly and place onto a wire rack. 
* Once the first batch of chicken is dredged and ready for frying, carefully lower them into the oil. Fry for about 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally so they don't stick to the bottom.
* Remove the chicken when the breasts have reached 150 degrees fahrenheight and the rest has reached 165 (This will be at different times). Place on the wire rack, sprinkle with salt, and wait 10 minutes for the chicken to cool.
* Enjoy!
