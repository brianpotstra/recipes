# Huevos Rancheros

Serves 2

## Ingredients
* 2 corn tortillas
* 1 can of black beans - drained and rinsed
* 2 cloves of garlic - finely minced
* 1 tbsp. cumin
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup feta cheese - crumbled
* 1 green onion - chopped
* olive oil
* salt and pepper
* lime wedges
* hot sauce

## Directions
* Put a small sauce pan on medium heat and add some olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add in the minced garlic and stir rapidly to prevent burning. Add the cumin and the beans and stir together. Add in 1/2 cup of water and cook until almost all of the water has evaporated (about 10 minutes). Remove from heat and use a potato masher to smash the beans. Cover the pan and set aside.
* Heat the tortillas in a frying pan and then wrap them in a kitchen towel to keep warm.
* Keep the frying pan on the heat and add some olive oil. Fry the 2 eggs until the whites are cooked, but the yokes are still a bit runny. Remove pan from heat.
* Place a tortilla on a plate and spread a few spoonfuls of beans on it. Add the fried egg on top, then garnish with the feta cheese and green onions. Add a couple splashes of hot sauce and a lime wedge for squeezing over.
