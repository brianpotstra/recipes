# Roasted Vegetable Pasta
Serves 2

## Ingredients
* 1 zuchini - sliced into coins
* 1 pack cherry tomatos
* 2 bulbs of garlic - cloves removed and peeled
* 1 yellow pepper - chopped
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese - grated
* salt and pepper
* a few basil leaves (optional)
* olive oil

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and distribute the zuchini, peppers, garic cloves, peppers and tomatos. Lightly drizzle some olive oil over the vegetables and sprinkle some salt and pepper over them. Once oven is preheated, toss the vegetables on a high rack and roast for 30 minutes.
* Put a large pot of lightly salted water on high heat to boil. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Drain, reserving some of the cooking water.
* When the vegetables are cooked, add them to the pot of pasta and stir in the butter and parmesan until melted. You may want to add in a few splashes of the cooking water to loosen things up. 
* Serve with some more grated parmesan, pepper, and some chopped basil leaves if you like.
