# Asian Salmon en Croute
Serves 2

## Ingredients
* 2 portions Salmon fillets
* 1 green onion
* 1 red chili pepper (cayenne is best)
* 1 can sliced water chesnuts - drained 
* 1 lemon
* 2 small bunches of sugar snap peas
* 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* Parchment paper or Aluminum foil
* Basmati rice

## Directions
* Heat an oven to 420F
* Peel the ginger and finely grate it into a small bowl
* Using a garlic press, squash the garlic cloves into the bowl with the ginger  (If you don't have a garlic press, you can finely slice it using a sharp knife)
* Finely slice the chili and green onion, and add them to the bowl
* Pour in the olive oil and soy sauce, then squeeze in the juice from half of the lemon
* Give the mixture a good stir and let it rest to give the flavours a chance to combine
* Take out 2 large sheets of parchment paper (or aluminum foil works too) and lay 1 salmon fillet (skin-side down) onto the center of each sheet
* Carefully pour half of the sauce mixture over each piece - If it starts to run, fold the edges of the paper or foil to form little walls
* Divide the water chesnuts and peas, and place them over each piece of salmon
* Now carefully fold up the edges of the paper to make 'pockets' - you want to get as good of a seal as possible to trap in the steam while cooking
* Place each pocket on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of your fillets
* Open carefully, to prevent steam burns and slide a spatula (or slotted turner) under the fish meat but above the skin - You should be able to lift the entire fillet while leaving the skin inside the pocket

Serve with fluffy Basmatti rice

NOTE - water chesnuts and peas are great, but you can also use bok choi, broccoli or green beans.
