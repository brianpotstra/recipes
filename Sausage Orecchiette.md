# Sausage Orecchiette
Serves 4

## Ingredients
* 4 Italian sausages
* 1 package Orecchiette http://ohsoverypretty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/orecchiette-brussel-sprouts-7.jpg
* 1/2 jar roasted red peppers - roughly chopped
* 1 cup kalamata olives - pitted
* 1 package cherry tomatos - halved
* 2/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup butter
* pepper

## Directions
* Get a large pot of lightly salted water and put it on high heat.
* Cut open the sausages and place the meat in a frying pan on medium heat. Discard the sausage casings. Stir the sausage meat around, breaking it up as it cooks.
* Once the water has boiled, add the Orecchiette pasta and give it a stir to prevent it from sticking to the pot.
* When the sausage meat has lightly browned, add the olives, roasted red peppers and tomatos to the frying pan. After a few minutes, smash a few of the tomatos to release some of their juices.
* After the pasta has cooked (around 12 minutes), use a mug to scoop out some of the cooking water and drain the rest in a collander. Return drained pasta to the pot and dump in the sauage, pepper, olive and tomato mixture. Stir in the butter and parmesan cheese until melted. Add a few splashes of the pasta water to losen things up if you desire.
* Serve with some pepper, chili flakes or some more grated parmesan.
