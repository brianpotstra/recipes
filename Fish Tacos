# Fish Tacos
Serves 2

## Ingredients
* 2 tilapia fillets
* 2 tbsp cumin
* 1 cup sour cream
* 2 cups red cabbage - chopped
* 1 jalapeno
* 2 green onions - chopped
* 1 lime
* flour tortillas
* salt and pepper
* olive oil

## Directions
* Half the jalapeno and finely chop 1 of the halves. Set aside the other half.
* In a bowl, combine the sour cream, cabbage, chopped jalapeno and most of the chopped green onions. Squeeze in the juice from half of the lime and season with salt and pepper. Mix everything together and put into the fridge.
* Put a large frying pan on high heat and add in some olive oil. Once the oil is hot, toss in the jalapeno half and let it bubble for a few minutes to flavour the oil.]
* Meanwhile, sprinkle the cumin over the fish fillets and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place the fillets in the pan being careful not to splash hot oil on yourself. Fry the fish for a few minutes on each side, until the edges and surface has become slightly crispy.
* While the fish is cooking, warm the tortillas in a pan for a few minutes and wrap in a kitchen towel to keep warm.
* To assemble, place the fish on the tortilla and top with the cabbage mixture and some of the remaining green onions.
