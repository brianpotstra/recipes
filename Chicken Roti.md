# Chicken Roti
Serves 2-4

## Ingredients
* 6 chicken thighs - roughly chopped
* 1 potato - chopped into ~1cm cubes
* 1 can chick peas - drained and rinsed
* 1 can coconut milk
* 1 yellow or white onion - finely chopped
* 2 tbsp Caribbean curry powder
* 1 Scotch Bonnet pepper
* a couple pre-made roti shells (tortillas or pitas are a decent substitute)
* olive oil
* salt and pepper

## Directions
* Get a large pot and put it on medium heat. Once hot, add a few lugs of olive oil. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft but not caramelized. At this point, add the chicken thighs and curry powder and give it a stir.
* Once the chicken has lightly browned, add the potato, chick peas and coconut milk. Using a fork, poke a few holes in the Scotch Bonnet and toss it into the pot. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After 30 minutes, remove the Scotch Bonnet. If it has gotten too thick, add a few splashes of water. Season with salt and pepper.
* Serve in roti shells.
